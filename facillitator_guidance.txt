\
- Paraphrase and summarize long, complex, or ambiguous comments.\

- Good probing is not leading. Avoid asking questions that reflect your own assumptions about the topic.\
- Summarize and reflect back to the individual any key ideas from the responses to each question.\
- If the conversation gets off topic, restate the purpose of the research.\
\
REMINDERS FOR EACH SESSION\

\
WELCOME\
-------\
\
Welcome and thank you for being here today. The purpose of this conversation is to learn more about your perceptions of careers such as substance use disorder counseling, and reasons why you may or may not be interested in a behavioral health career. Using the information gathered from this conversation and other focus groups, the research team is hoping to develop ways to reduce barriers and improve pathways to substance use disorder counseling careers.\
\
My role will be to guide our conversation by asking questions intended to encourage dialogue. There are no right or wrong answers. The goal is simply to learn more about your individual experience. Please feel free to elaborate on topics that come up as we are talking. I hope this session will feel conversational.\
\
**Guidelines for Our Discussion:**\
\
- You do not have to answer any questions that you do not want to.\
- There are no right or wrong answers.\
- Since our time is limited, I may need to have us actively change topics from time to time.\
- The discussion will last for about one hour and I will be audio and video recording the session. Please keep your camera on as this is required in order to receive SONA research credit.\
- Please do not share the names of participants or any of the conversation today with individuals not present.\
